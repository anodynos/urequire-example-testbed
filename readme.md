A testbed project using [urequire](http://urequire.org) & [grunt-urequire](https://github.com/aearly/grunt-urequire).

Provides boilerplate & grunt/urequire config for cross module systems development and cross runtimes deployment.

It comes with tests that run on nodejs (mocha), phantomjs (mocha-phantomjs) and browser (Web/AMD & Web/Script).

## Usage:

### Download and install

```bash
$ git clone anodynos/urequire-example-testbed && cd urequire-example-testbed

$ npm install && bower install

$ npm install mocha -g

$ npm install mocha-phantomjs -g
```

### A full clean build & test.

Run the default build & specs test with `$ grunt`, that builds with UMD & combined and runs tests on nodejs (mocha) & browser (mocha-phantomjs).

The tests run with any combination of `$ grunt <lib> <specxxxRun>`, eg

```bash
$ grunt UMD specDevRun

   or

$ grunt min specRun

```

The mocha & HTML specs are automatically generated by the `afterBuild`-er [`urequire-ab-specrunner`](http://github.com/anodynos/urequire-ab-specrunner), which knowns the paths, dependencies etc from the urequire config.

### Watch file changes (code & specs),

You can see urequire in action, rebuilding & running specs *only* when stuff _really_ changes.

Again you can issue any combination of `$ grunt <lib> <specxxxWatch>`, for example:

```bash

$ grunt UMD specWatch

        or

$ grunt dev specDevWatch

        or any combination of the two, eg

$ grunt UMD specDevWatch

```
